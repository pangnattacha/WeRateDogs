# Project: How does WeRateDogs™ rate the dogs?

## Introduction
WeRateDogs™ is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings always have a denominator of 10, but the ratings are always greater than 10, i.e. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, aka [WeRateDogs™](https://twitter.com/dog_rates).

## Key finding
From data analysis, some insights regarding WeRateDog™ dataset were found:
- WeRateDog™ rates dogs just for fun. The rating should not be the measurement to evaluate the popularity of dogs.
- Either retweet_count or favorite_count would give similar interpretation when using them to measure the popularity of the dogs.
- It is likely that WeRateDogs™ rated images that are no dogs in them under 10.
- Golden retriever, labrador retriever, and pembroke are the top three most popular dogs from this dataset.
